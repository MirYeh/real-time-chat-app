## Run for the first time

- Make sure you have Node.js installed

- Make sure to use the correct Node version. In this project we use `fnm` to switch between versions, and [follow the shell setup](https://github.com/Schniz/fnm#shell-setup) to automatically switch to the project's Node version.

- Then run:


```
npm i
```

```
npm run start
```

- navigate to http://localhost:3000

- Enter a username and start chatting!
